CLEARANCE: US SECRET
WORK & RESEARCH EXPERIENCE:
Science Systems and Solutions, Inc. – Research Assistant July 2016 to Present
• Supported a senior staff member in developing and testing algorithms and code, translating signal
processing software developed in Fortran into Matlab and to C/C++, analyzing synthetic and field radar
data to test detection and tracking algorithms
• Under a subcontract with Lockheed, support senior staff member to develop software to detect and to
track people moving under trees using foliage penetration (FOPEN) radar systems
• Supported a senior staff on a Navy Phase 1 SBIR program to develop Matlab software to perform 3-D
ISAR imaging of ships from collected raw complex radar data.
RDRTec Inc. Paid internship June 2014 to June 2016
• Responsible for helping RDRTec research scientists develop, implement, and test algorithms in Matlab
as well as prepare Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) proposals.
• Involved in developing and testing 6-DOF hydrodynamic code of moving vessels in Matlab and testing
radar-based 3-D inverse synthetic radar imaging of moving vessels.
• A second project that I am working on involves developing and testing Constant False Alarm Rate
detectors for small boats by analyzing sea clutter statistical distributions.
• SBIR Proposals that I helped win – December 2014
- Navy Topic N141-067 Phase 2 ($500,000 Base, $250,000 Option): “Adaptive Radar Detection.
Approaches for Low-RCS Maritime Vessels in Highly Variable Clutter Conditions” – Contract
Number N00014-14-P-1146 (awarded September 2015).
- Navy Topic N141-018 Phase 2 ($750,000 Base, $250,000 Option): “Efficient 3-D Imaging for
Improved Classification and Persistent Tracking” – Contract Number N68335-14-C-0263
UCSD San Diego Super Computer Center Internship June 2015 to June 2016
• Working with Dr. Peter Rose in a team with 5 other students to develop a Java based software package
to reduce the computational complexity required to compute Protein-to-Protein comparison based on
structures represented in the PDB (protein database).
• Used a well-known manifold learning approach to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by
mapping the Protein-protein matching problem into a lower dimensional manifold.
